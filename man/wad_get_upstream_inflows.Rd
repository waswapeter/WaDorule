\title{Get aggregated upstream inflows}
\usage{
wad_get_upstream_inflows(
  sites,
  start_date,
  end_date,
  units = "m3s",
  na_rm = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sites}{Character vector of USGS site numbers (one or more)}

\item{start_date}{Start date (YYYY-MM-DD)}

\item{end_date}{End date (YYYY-MM-DD)}

\item{units}{Output units ("m3s" or "cfs")}

\item{na_rm}{Logical; remove NA values when aggregating}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns Date and Q_upstream
}
\description{
Downloads daily discharge from one or more upstream USGS gauges and
aggregates them into a single upstream inflow time series.
}
\details{
Daily upstream inflows are computed as the sum of all available upstream
tributary discharges, obtained from USGS daily-value gauges. When multiple
tributaries exist, inflows are aggregated by date to form a single composite
upstream inflow time series. If only one gauge is provided, the inflow equals
the discharge at that gauge.

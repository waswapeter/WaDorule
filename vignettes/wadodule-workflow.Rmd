## Upstream inflow aggregation

WaDorule computes reservoir inflows using daily discharge records from upstream tributary gauges. All available tributary inflows are aggregated by date to form a single composite upstream inflow time series:

\[
Q_{\text{upstream}}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} Q_i(t)
\]

where \( Q_i(t) \) denotes the daily discharge at tributary \( i \), and \( N \) is the number of upstream gauges. When only one upstream gauge is available, the inflow time series equals the discharge at that gauge.

This approach ensures hydrologic consistency and allows WaDorule to be applied uniformly across reservoirs with varying numbers of upstream tributaries.
